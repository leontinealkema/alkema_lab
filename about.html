                        <p>
                          We develop statistical models to assess trends and differentials in key indicators in reproductive,
                          maternal and child health and demography, focusing on two main areas:
                          <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                            <li>Family planning ~ contraceptive use and need, unintended pregnancies, abortions, fertility</li>
                            <li>Child and maternal mortality</li>
                          </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Model findings include population-level estimates of demographic and population-health trends as well
                          as the description of global patterns of change, the identification of populations with outlying levels or
                          trends, and comprehensive assessments of data quality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          We gratefully acknowledge funding for family planning research by the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation (PI Alkema) and for data quality issues in sibling histories by NIH (PI: Helleringer).
We are passionate about collaborating with substantive experts and making available improved
estimation methods and resulting estimates to diverse international audiences. To that end, we
collaborate with various United Nations groups and organizations in the areas of global health and
family planning. The statistical methods that we have developed for child mortality, maternal mortality,
and family planning indicators [preobably some refs in those] are in use by relevant UN agencies and
WHO for monitoring. Child and maternal mortality methods [refs] have been used to produce estimates
for the final assessment of UN Millennium Development Goals and are in use for monitoring progress
toward the Sustainable Development Goals. Family planning estimation methods [refs] are being used
for monitoring in the FP2020 initiative by Track20 using the web-based application FPET (see

fpet.track20.org). Lastly, we collaborate with \textit{the Guttmacher Institute} (link) on the estimation of
abortion incidence and pregnancy rates, with intention status.

                         Main methodological challenges in this area of research are:
                        - \item How to best use diverse data types with varying levels of bias and/or random measurement
                        errors?
                        - \item How to capture data-driven trends in data-rich populations, while also producing reliable
                        estimates for populations where data are limited, with appropriate levels of uncertainty?
                        - \item How to identify populations with outlying levels or trends?
                        - \item How to construct probabilistic projections that are unbiased and well-calibrated?
                        Our research has addressed these methodological challenges for various indicators via the
                        conceptualization, development, and validation of context-specific Bayesian models. Key components of
                        these models are:
                        - \item the parameterization of biases and measurement error variances to account for data
                        quality issues.
                        - \item the specification of models that capture systematic trends or relationships,
                        - \item hierarchical submodels to allow for ``sharing&#39;&#39; of information across populations to inform
                        the estimates and projections for data-sparse populations, and
                        Model findings include population-level estimates of demographic and population-health trends as well
                        as the description of global patterns of change, the identification of populations with outlying levels or
                        trends, and comprehensive assessments of data quality.
                        Additional methodological contributions to the field include guidance on model validation \ssp{},
                        population-specific target setting \target{}, as well as the reporting and interpretation of population
                        estimates and associated uncertainty \mikkel{} \cdata{}. We also contributed to GATHER, a new set of
                        consensus guidelines which have been adopted by leading journals.

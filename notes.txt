modified javascript file "bootstrap.portfilter" to split strings into two tags
it then checks each tag and if either matches an element it is selected

added javascript to the top of publications page which uses a loop to check each button upon selection
if the button was not the most recent selection it has its style nullified
this combined with the custom style called "mystyle" allows the buttons to stay selected
when other page elements are selected yet deselect itself if another "demo" button is pressed
